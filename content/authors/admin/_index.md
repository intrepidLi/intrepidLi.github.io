I'm a CS PhD student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof.Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/irwin-king/). I'm now interested in the fields of recommendation systems and LLMs, special in generative recommendation systems and LLM post-training. I'd like to make these systems more effective and user-friendly. Here is my [English CV](uploads/resume_en.pdf) and [Chinese CV](uploads/resume_zh.pdf).
